# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use Javascript to create a html page that shows a data table of UFO sightings.  The table can filtered by entering values for Date, City, State, Country or Shape.

## Results
When a user goes to our webpage they are able to filter by numerous search criteria.
Below is the default table view of when a user first visits the page:

As you can see there is data for multiple states - you can filter to just one using the filter highlighted below.

You can further filter by city.

Lastly, for this example we'll filter by shape.

## Summary
One current limitation is that all the filters are free text - this opens the door for manual error when typing in a city for example.  A better option would be a dropdown list that only shows relevant values.
